Made by Ethan Nguyen-Tu using React with Next.js, this Profit and Loss Calendar App is designed to help you track your daily profit and loss by providing a simple and intuitive interface for entering and viewing your financial data.

All inputted data is stored locally in your browser's storage, ensuring your information is kept private and secure. You can easily export your data as a JSON file by clicking the "Export" button at the top of the calendar to save your changes. This exported data can then be imported back into the application by clicking the "Import" button when you next open the calendar, allowing you to restore your changes.
